## Installing  
### FreeCAD Addon Manager
**WorkFeature-WB** is part of the [FreeCAD external workbenches,](https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/External_workbenches)
 and can be automatically installed using the [FreeCAD Add-on Manager](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons) which comes bundled with FreeCAD 0.17, under the *Tools* menu. 

See repository at https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-addons for more details on add-ons for FreeCAD.

### Manually Installing 
<details>
  <summary>In general, manual installation is not necessary anymore, but in specific situations it's available. Uncollapse this section to learn more.</summary>
You can also install manually this workbench by (e.g, on Linux system):
  - Cloning the repository from github (https://github.com/Rentlau/WorkFeature-WB) using:

```
> mkdir /home/your_name/path_to_WorkFeature-WB
> cd /home/your_name/path_to_WorkFeature-WB/
> git clone https://github.com/Rentlau/WorkFeature-WB.git

```

  - *Or download from github the zip file : <b>WorkFeature-WB-master.zip</b> and extract it into "/home/your_name/path_to_WorkFeature-WB"*

  - Then by making a symbolic link into "freecad installation folder"/Mod (most of the time <b>/home/your_name/.FreeCAD/Mod/</b>)<br>
  Into your home directory you must have a similar directory /home/your_name/.FreeCAD/Mod/<br>
  This is the place all your extra workbench add-ons are installed ! :<br>

```
> ln -s /home/your_name/path_to_WorkFeature-WB /home/your_name/.FreeCAD/Mod/
```

  - *Or copy the "/home/your_name/path_to_WorkFeature-WB" directory into into "freecad installation folder"/Mod add-ons directory :<br>*

```
cp /home/your_name/path_to_WorkFeature-WB /home/your_name/.FreeCAD/Mod/
```

On Windows most of the time the place all your extra workbench add-ons are installed is <b>C:\Program Files\FreeCAD 0.16\Mod\WorkeFeature-WB-master</b>.

## Requirements

- <b>Freecad</b> >= v0.15
- <b>Numpy</b> is a required dependency (numpy >= v1.14.3).

**Important Note:**  
The development of the macro was originally done with Python2.7. The project is now developed under Python 3.6. Therefore this workbench may work fully under FreeCAD v0.18 or higher. Please "[Open an issue](https://github.com/Rentlau/WorkFeature-WB/issues)", if you detect any problems related to py3 compatibility or anything else.

## General purpose

**WorkFeature-WB** Tool utility to create **Points** (mid points, center of circle...), **Axes** (from 2 points...), **Planes** (from one axis and a point...) to facilitate the creation of your project. 

The idea behind this python workbench for FreeCAD was to give users some "quick" access tiny tools.

Most of the tools available in this workbench require less "clicks" then normal operations, this is intentional behavior to give the user quick access to functionalities.

This **workbench** will create, in your FreeCAD document, a new Group named `WorkFeatures`.  
Depending on the tool you will use, some objects can be created under the following subgroups:  
```
- WorkFeatures/
  - WorkPoints_P
  - WorkAxes_P
  - WorkPlanes_P
```

Most **objects** created with the **WorkFeature-WB** functions are parametric. In other words, if the **"parent"** object changes, all **children WorkFeature-WB** objects will change accordingly!  

The **"Parametric"** property of objects can have any of the following behavior regarding parent changes:  
- **Not** : For static behavior (No update even if one parents change).  
- **Interactive** : Update only when user asks for (click on **`Update`** Button).  
- **Dynamic** : Update each time one of parents change.  

A color code regarding the **"Parametric"** property is used:

| | |
|:------|:------|
|**Not** parametric color | ![alt](./Resources/Icons/WF_pointNot.svg) |
|**Interactive** parametric color | ![alt](./Resources/Icons/WF_pointInteractive.svg) |
|**Dynamic** parametric color | ![alt](./Resources/Icons/WF_pointDynamic.svg) |

The **"Parametric"** property can be changed for each single object in it's own **Data** panel:

![alt](./Doc/Images/Parametric.png?1)


| Name                           | Icon  |
|:------|:------|
|In General menu click the **`Update`** Button to update all **WorkFeature-WB Interactive** objects | ![alt](./Resources/Icons/WF_refresh.svg) |

After **activation** of the workbench, general preferences can be set in `Edit/Preferences` menu.

In this panel you can choose by example to set the **Parametric behavior**:

![alt](./Doc/Images/Preferences.png?2)

Hereafter the Graph of relationship shows that the parametric **WorkFeature-WB** Object **CenterLinePoint_P001** is depending on 
**Line002** object, but not the **MidPoint001**!

**<span style="color:red">Unsuppported as of 2019 release</span>**|

Most of the time a click on a button without any a prior selection will end up with a
Popup window message:

![alt](./Doc/Images/Message.png) 

This Window by default will close after a few seconds.

This behavior can be changed or deactivated (with Time Out=0) in **general preferences Menu**.
