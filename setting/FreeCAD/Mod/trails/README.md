# FreeCAD Trails Workbench (Transportation and Geomatics)

Hakan Seven is a Geomatics Engineer and Joel_graff is a Transportation Engineer. We decide to create a workbench for our own needs. So this workbench is being developed to provide functionality specific to Transportation and Geomatics engineering.

## Features

## Installation

### Easy
Go to releases: https://github.com/joelgraff/freecad.trails/releases

Download and extract the ZIP file into the `.FreeCAD/Mod` folder.

**Note:** This releases are not up to date. So maybe you can't find the newly added features.

### Hard
FreeCAD-Trails depends on the [pivy_trackers 2D geometry library] https://github.com/joelgraff/pivy_trackers and my own [FreeCAD_python_support] https://github.com/joelgraff/freecad_python_support repo to run.  Pivy_trackers provides low-level 2D rendering support through Python for FreeCAD.  FreeCAD_python_support is a collection of python support functions.  Both are included in the FreeCAD Trails project as submodules.

In order to clone the repo with the complete supporting submodules, invoke git from the /Mod folder at the commandline as follows:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/joelgraff/freecad.trails.git`
